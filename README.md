# 🎨 AI Art Descriptor & PDF Generator 

A Streamlit web application that generates compelling descriptions for your artworks using OpenAI, and compiles them into a neat one-page PDF. It also stores artwork data in MongoDB to prevent redundant processing and enhance performance.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🧠 **AI-Powered Descriptions**: Automatically generate meaningful, elegant descriptions for your artworks using OpenAI's language model.
- 📄 **One-Page PDF Generation**: Export the artwork details along with its description into a single-page PDF.
- 🗃️ **MongoDB Integration**: Avoid repeat generation and save time with efficient artwork metadata storage.
- 🎨 **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Streamlit for a simple and intuitive experience.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- OpenAI API Key
- MongoDB connection URI

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/art-descriptor-app.git
cd art-descriptor-app
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the project root and add the following:

OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_uri
```
```Run the App

```
## 🧾 How It Works

1. **Upload your artwork** or enter artwork details.
2. The app checks **MongoDB** for existing entries based on the artwork's **hash or title**.
3. If it's a **new entry**, OpenAI generates a description.
4. A **one-page PDF** is created with all metadata and description.
5. The data is **saved in MongoDB** for future use.
